# bootanimation
create a bootanimation using boot.py, zip including desc.txt [storage, no compression](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/cmds/bootanimation/FORMAT.md), install using boot.sh  
tested on 7.1 - nougat  
you have to add a square image (and possibly adjust value u and o in boot.py) with (ideally, but you can replace the white) white contents and a black background named img.png  
intended for a logo set at 45 degreees, this will paste it on a 4x5 grid with every other logo being flipped (so that is looks good no matter the orientation) and lets the logos shine in a cute animation :)
